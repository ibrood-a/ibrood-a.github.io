                <h1>My Exploration of GitHub Profile</h1>
                <p>Published on: October 10, 2023</p>
                
                <p>As a computer science major working towards my degree, I am always eager to learn and explore the work of fellow programmers. I recently came across Jacob Kennedy, who has a fascinating GitHub profile. Let's delve into some of the intriguing repositories I found on this GitHub profile:</p>
                
                <h3>cosc2436-lab10 (C++)</h3>
                <p>I was immediately drawn to a C++ project. This repository likely contains code related to my coursework or personal projects in C++.</p>
                
                <h3>T-Mobile-price-plan-calculator (HTML)</h3>
                <p>What caught my eye even more was a project I created to calculate T-Mobile plan pricing. This tool is designed to help me and my co-workers calculate plan prices accurately, as the tools provided by our company are often unreliable.</p>
                
                <h3>Ackermann-ARM-Assembly (Assembly)</h3>
                <p>Another fascinating repository, this one is related to ARM Assembly programming. It showcases my skills in low-level programming and adds to the diversity of my GitHub work.</p>
                
                <h3>Guessing-Game-ARM-Assembly (Assembly)</h3>
                <p>My curiosity led me to yet another ARM Assembly project, which appears to be a guessing game implemented in Assembly. It clearly demonstrates my expertise in creating programs in Assembly language.</p>
                
                <h3>Binary-Search-Tree (C++)</h3>
                <p>I have a repository dedicated to a Binary Search Tree implemented in C++. This is an excellent example of my proficiency in data structures and algorithms, which is an area I find particularly exciting.</p>
                
                <h3>Radix-Sort (C++)</h3>
                <p>Another repository focusing on Radix Sort implemented in C++. Radix Sort is a fundamental sorting algorithm, and this project highlights my skills in algorithm design and implementation.</p>
                
                <p>If you're passionate about computer science and programming like me, I encourage you to explore my GitHub profile further to dive into these repositories and appreciate the skills and knowledge I bring to the table.</p>
